### What is this?
This is a ricing tool (in development) for Mac and (soon) linux (and maybe also Windows, but then it isn't a ricing tool anymore)
### Todo:
* [ ] Finish GUI 
* [ ] Write driver code for tinting icons based on desktop/colour picker
* [ ] Make this able to be built from scratch using just cmake and wxwidgets on different platforms
* [ ] Run gui and file-setting code in seperate threads 
* also fix scoping lol
